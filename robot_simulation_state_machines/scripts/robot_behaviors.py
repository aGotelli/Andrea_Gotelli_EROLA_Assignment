#   Description :
#
#   This file uses smach libraries to generate two state machines, which are used to control the
#   behaviors of the robot. Specifically, the state machines defines the transition from a state to
#   another using the interface provided by smach. There is a top level state machine defining two
#   of the three main robot behaviors. The last behavior is defined by the states of a sub state
#   machine.
#   The states are defined in the respective classes, and the transistions are automatically performed
#   by the state machine from the smach libraries.

#   \brief  imageReceived   Is the subscriber callback for the images published by the camera. It also performs
#           some image processing.
#   \param  ros_data Is the image received, which is of type sensor_msgs/CompressedImage.
#
#   This funtion first converts the image from the type received from the camera to an imgace which can be
#   processed by OpenCV. Then it performs some image processing first by blurring and filtering the image,
#   then by selecting element of a certain color. The color is indicated in the function itself.
#   After having detected the object of given color, it takes into account only the bigger of them.
#   It evaluates the circle which contains the object, computing the center and the radius.
#   Based on the value of the radius, the function determines either if the robot has reached the
#   ball or if it should move closer to it. In this last case, it computes a geometry_msgs/Twist message
#   containing an adjustement of the heading, for having the ball centered in the image, and a linear
#   velocity to move the robot closer to the ball. It also changes the value or the gobal boolean
#   ball_detected to True.
#   On the other hand,if the radius is equal or bigger than a given threshold, it assumes that the robot
#   has reached the ball and it sets the corresponding variable ball_reached to True.
#   Finally, in the case that none of the previusly happened, it sets both the global boolean ball_detected
#   and ball_reached to False.

#   \class SetHeadStraight
#   \brief This class defines the state of the state machine corresponding to the robot turning the head back to the normal orientation.
#
#   This class inheritates from smach and it consist of a state in the state machine. The state
#   that is represented here is a substate of the state Play. In this state the robot turns the head in order to
#   return to the original configuration.
#   As part of the smach class, this class has the member function execute() providing the intended behavior.
#   For more details about the content of this class, see the member function documentation.
