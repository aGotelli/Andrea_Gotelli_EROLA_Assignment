#   Description :
#
#   This file uses smach libraries to generate a state machine, which is used to control the
#   behaviors of the robot. Specifically, the state machine defines the transition from a state to
#   another using the interface provided by smach.
#
#   This file could be considered the head of the simulation an its more complex and important part.
#
#   The states are defined in the respective classes, and the transistions are automatically performed
#   by the state machine from the smach libraries.

#   \class Move
#   \brief This class defines the state of the state machine corresponding to the ball randomly moving
#
#   This class inheritates from smach and it consist of a state in the state machine. The state
#   that is represented here is the Move state. In this state the ball moves around randomly.
#   As part of the smach class, this class has the member function execute()
#   providing the intended behavior. For more details about the content of this class, see the member functions
#   documentation.

    #   \param userdata Unused parameter in order to pass userdata to the function.
    #   \return a string consisting of the state outcome
    #
    #   This member function enters in two subsequent loops. The first loop ensures that the
    #   ROS enviroment is still available, i.e. that the roscore is still operating, and
    #   it enters in a second loop which iterates for a fixed number of time the moving
    #   sequence. The number of time is given by the global variable number_of_movements.
    #
    #   The moving sequence is simply obtained by the creation of a random position within the
    #   world, and then the position is fed into the function reachPosition.
    #
    #   After the last motion, the function returns a string in order to change the state into "hide"

    #   parameter wait is setted to true in order to make the function blocking. Moreover, it
    #   waits a random amount of time calling the function waitForRandTime with default parameters.
