#   Description :
#
#   This file uses smach libraries to generate a state machine, which is used to control the
#   behaviors of the robot. Specifically, the state machine defines the transition from a state to
#   another using the interface provided by smach.
#
#   This file could be considered the head of the simulation an its more complex and important part.
#
#   The states are defined in the respective classes, and the transistions are automatically performed
#   by the state machine from the smach libraries.
